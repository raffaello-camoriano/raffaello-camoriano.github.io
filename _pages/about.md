**Senior Postdoctoral Researcher** at [Politecnico di Torino](http://polito.it/), Department of Control and Computer Engineering (DAUIN). Member of the Visual and Multimodal Applied Learning Lab ([VANDAL](http://vandal.polito.it/)) and the [ELLIS Turin Unit](https://ellis.eu/units/turin).

I am a Senior Postdoctoral Researcher at [Politecnico di Torino](http://polito.it/), in the VANDAL group at the DAUIN department and within the ELLIS Turin Unit. My research interests lie at the intersection between the Science and the Engineering of artificial learning systems. In particular, my work is focused on devising theoretically-grounded Machine Learning methods capable of scaling up to large and structured datasets, adapting to changing conditions in time, and efficiently interacting with their environments to learn faster and generalize better. I also find Robotics to be a rich source of ‒and a particularly well-suited testing platform for‒ challenging open research problems, often calling for the development of novel Machine Learning methods. My work in this direction mainly spans reinforcement and supervised learning for locomotion control, model learning, and visual object recognition.

Earlier on, I obtained my B. Sc. in Computer Engineering cum laude in 2011 and my M. Sc. in Robotics Engineering with top grades in 2013 from the University of Genoa (UniGe), Italy, where I received a 5-year ISICT/ISSUGE scholarship and a regional government prize for excellent students. I completed my Ph. D. in Bioengineering and Robotics (curriculum in humanoid robotics) at UniGe in 2017 working at the Italian Institute of Technology (IIT) under the supervision of Proff. Giorgio Metta and Lorenzo Rosasco. I was awarded the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society Italy Section Chapter’s 2017 Best Ph. D. Thesis Award for my Thesis "Large-scale Kernel Methods and Applications to Lifelong Robot Learning". 
Later on, I worked as a PostDoc at IIT from 2017 to 2022 on machine learning (efficient and scalable kernel methods, lifelong/incremental learning, and reinforcement learning) and applications to robotics (model learning, locomotion control, and robot vision) in collaboration with Proff. Lorenzo Rosasco, Lorenzo Natale, and Daniele Pucci. Our recent paper "On the Emergence of Whole-body Strategies from Humanoid Robot Push-recovery Learning" was nominated as finalist for the best paper award at IEEE Humanoids 2020.
